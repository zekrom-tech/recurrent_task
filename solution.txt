Issue Diagnosis:
The user is encountering a 403 Forbidden error when trying to push to the repository 'https://github.com/zekrom-tech/recurrent_task.git'.
The error message "Permission to zekrom-tech/recurrent_task.git denied to Vigneshcherugoli" indicates that the git client is authenticating as user 'Vigneshcherugoli', but this user does not have write permissions to the 'zekrom-tech/recurrent_task' repository.
The local git configuration has user.name set to 'zekrom-tech', confirming the intention to work as the organization/owner.

Steps Taken:
1. Checked local git status and configuration.
   - Current branch: master
   - Remote URL: https://github.com/zekrom-tech/recurrent_task.git
   - Git User: zekrom-tech

2. Updated remote URL to include the username to force incorrect credential bypass.
   - Command: git remote set-url origin https://zekrom-tech@github.com/zekrom-tech/recurrent_task.git
   - Purpose: This forces Git to attempt authentication for 'zekrom-tech' specifically, rather than using the cached 'Vigneshcherugoli' credentials.

3. Attempting to push changes.
   - Command: git push -u origin master
   - Status: Success!
   - Output: Branch 'master' set up to track 'origin/master'.

Result:
The permission error was resolved by forcing the use of the correct username ('zekrom-tech') in the remote URL. This prompted a re-authentication or used the correct cached credentials, allowing the push to complete successfully.
